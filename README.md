**Final Project report**
This is a scatter plot of movies in the last 10 years with menus for X, Y, Z and color. We can select features for X, Y, Z and color. We can also see the details of each point when mouse hovers over that point.
1.Data
- Dataset: 1,000 most popular movies on IMDB in the last 10 years.
- This dataset contains several features:
  - Rank,Title,Genre,Description,Director,Actors,Year,Runtime,Rating,Votes,Revenue,Metascore. [Here is the link](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data/data)
  
2.Prototype
- Year can be selected in the color dropdown box.
  - Below I selected Year and it is the legend.
- X-axis, y-axis, z-axis (radius of each point) can be selected from Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue,
Metascore.
  - In the example, I selected Rating as x-axis, Votes as y-axis, Runtime as z-axis.
- We can get the details of each movie by clicking on the point.
- The legend can also serve as a filter.
  - For example, when legend is year, we can select movies made in 2011,2005 and 2014.
Built with [blockbuilder.org](http://blockbuilder.org)

3.Questions
- Are there any correlations between Runtime and Rating?
- What are the relationships between Runtime, Rating, Votes, Revenue and Metascore?
- Is it correct, the older the movie is, the more votes it will have?
